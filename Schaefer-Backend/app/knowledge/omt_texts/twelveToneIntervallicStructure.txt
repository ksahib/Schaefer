Twelve-Tone Music — Intervallic Structure
Pitch-class orderings are not the only things ordered by twelve-tone rows. Because pitch classes are always in relationships with one another, a twelve-tone row is also an ordered collection of
intervals.
Understanding the intervallic structure of a row class is the best way to get a sense of what it will sound like.
Below, you’ll see the figure from resource on
operations
. Below each of the row forms in that example, I have shown the series of
ordered pitch-class intervals
.
Rows that are
transpositionally-related
(as
P11
and
P10
are) have
the same
series of ordered pitch-class intervals.
Rows that are
inversionally-related
(as
P10
and
I0
are) have
complementary
ordered pitch-class intervals. That is, intervals in corresponding locations in the row forms “sum to 12.”
Rows that are
retrograde-related
have ordered pitch-class intervals that are
reverse complements
. Compare
P10
and
R10
. Reading
R10
backwards, the
final
three intervals (for example) are 4 1 8. Those are the complements of
P10
′s
first
three intervals: 8 11 4.
Rows that are
retrograde-inversion related
have ordered pitch-class intervals that are
reverses
of one another. Compare
P10
and
RI0
. Reading
RI0
′s intervals backwards, you’ll notice that they are the
same
as
P10
′s read forwards.
