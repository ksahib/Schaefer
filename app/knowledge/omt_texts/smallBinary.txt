The small binary
The small binary often fulfills a structural role similar to that as the small ternary. It can be the main theme of any of the full-movement forms, but is most often found as the theme of a theme and variations,
rondo
, or the
minuet and trio
.
Small binaries have two parts, each of which is usually repeated. Unlike the
“rounded binary,”
small binaries
do not
include a recapitulation of the material heard in the
first part
.
The small binary
###First part
Typically constructed as tight-knit
period
,
sentence
, or
hybrid
, the
first part
ends with cadential articulation in the home key or a closely related one. Because a small binary is often smaller than that of the
small ternary,
it is not uncommon to find a I:HC at the close of the first part.
###Second part
The
second part
of a small binary quite often begins like a contrasting middle. The material that
follows
the
contrasting middle
, however, is not a
recapitulation
. If it were, the theme would be a
small ternary
. Rather, this material takes on a variety of guises. Often, it resembles one of the common “after-phrases”–
continuation
,
consequent,
or
cadential.
In the classical style, the second part of a small binary will always close with a I:PAC.
###An example
Mozart, Violin Sonata in A major, K. 305
In this small binary, the
first part
is created by a simple period that modulates to and closes in the dominant key with a V:PAC. A
contrasting middle
follows, where we see a typical
“standing on the dominant”
to support a prolongation of V7. Notice that the motivic material in the
contrasting middle
is quite similar to the motivic material we hear in the
first part.
This is typical of a small binary, whose
second part
does not contrast with the
first part
to such a high degree as in the
small ternary.
Following the
contrasting middle
, the final four measures of this example resemble a continuation: the melodic motive we hear in the
contrasting material
is fragmented and sequenced, and begins, with the pickup to the penultimate measure, a cadence.
