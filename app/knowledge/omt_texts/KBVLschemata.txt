Keyboard-style voice-leading schemata
Following are a number of
schemata
for keyboard-style voice-leading. Some of these are patterns that are common enough to warrant special attention (and memorization). Others require non-default voice-leading or doublings. In any case, these are worth memorizing to assist both in composition/arranging and in recognition of standard patterns. (Some will also come in handy for chorale-style voice-leading.)
Voice exchange
A
voice exchange
occurs when the melody and bass lines exchange pitches over the course of a simple contrapuntal prolongation. For example, in the progression
T1 D2 T3
, the bass begins on
do
and ends on
mi
. In a voice exchange, the melody would reverse this, starting on
mi
and ending on
do
. This common pattern can use a
V
6/4
,
V
4/3
, or a
VII
6/3
chord for
D2
:
Using this voice exchange pattern will ensure smooth voice-leading throughout the prolongation.
Note that the
fa
in the
D2
passing chord (a functional dissonance) of the second example does
not
resolve down to
mi
. This is permissible because
mi
is required of the bass line but cannot be doubled, and because the smooth outer-voice counterpoint and stepwise inner-voice motion counteract any harshness perceived by the unresolved dissonance.
The voice exchange can also be used with a
D4
substitution chord. Note that the upper voices will be exactly the same as using a
V
6/4
for
D2
.
These patterns can be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and the
D2
voice exchanges can be used in reverse, as well—
T3 D2 T1
. They can also be used to prolong S and D:
S4 T5 S6
or
D5 S6 D7
, for example.
Parallel tenths
Do–re–mi
in the bass is also frequently accompanied by
mi–fa–sol
in the melody, making
parallel tenths
.
Note here that, like the
fa
in the
D2
voice exchange, the
fa
in the melody is an unresolved functional dissonance. In this case, the voice leading once again is so smooth that it overrides the need for the functional dissonance to resolve.
This pattern can also be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and in reverse. It almost always uses a
V
4/3
for
D2
.
Champagne progression
While
T(1 D2p 3)
is a perfectly acceptable way to accompany
mi–fa–sol
in the melody, a more interesting (and also more involved) way to harmonize that melody is what theorist Gene Biringer called the
champagne progression
:
T1 S6 T3
. (He called it this because it is “the progression you use when you want to impress a date.”)
The champagne progression is very nice, but must be treated carefully.
Only
use it with
mi–fa–sol
(or
me–fa–sol
) in the melody, and
always
use the following voice-leading (note the non-standard doubling of the bass—
la
/
le
—in the
S6
chord).
The standard champagne progression (above) uses a
I
6
chord for
T3
. Following is a variant using
III
for
T3
, which Biringer dubbed “pink champagne,” because it is especially nice. It should also be especially
rare
, or it loses its punch.
The champagne progression should only be used to prolong tonic function.
Deceptive resolution
A
deceptive resolution
occurs When a
D5
(
V
or
V
7
) chord does not progress, as expected, to
I
to form an authentic cadence, but instead progresses to
VI
. In the deceptive resolution, it is important for
ti
to resolve to
do
—as it would in an authentic cadence—not
la
/
le
. This fulfills its role as a tendency tone, helps the “deception” to work, and avoids the dissonant augmented second
ti
–
le
in minor. This results in a non-standard doubling of VI (
do
, rather than the bass).
Leaving out the fifth
When
ti
–
do
appears in the melody of an authentic cadence involving
V
7
, it is impossible to fully voice both chords
and
resolve the functional dissonance.
It is imperative to resolve this functional dissonance, as that resolution is an important contributor to the goal-oriented motion and the releasing of harmonic tension into the cadential arrival. In order to do so, either leave out the fifth of the
I
chord (and triple the bass):
or leave out the fifth of the
V
7
chord, and double the bass:
The incomplete
V
7
is preferable to the incomplete
I
, but voice-leading into the
V
7
will usually dictate which option you choose.
Leaving out the third
When an
S4
progresses into a
D5
, and both are
seventh chords
, it can be impossible to prepare and resolve the functional dissonances of both chords while fully voicing them.
Instead, leave
la
/
le
out of the
S4
chord and double the bass. This will retain the trigger and bass note
fa
, as well as the two pitches making the dissonance (
do
and
re
or
mi
/
me
and
fa
), and will allow a second
fa
in an upper voice that can prepare the seventh of the
D5
chord.
